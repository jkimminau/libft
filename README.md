# libft
Compilation of basic useful functions

## Introduction

Welcome to 42! If you don't know what 42, or you're currently in college or high school and looking for an opporunity to start learning how to code in an awesome, creative, **free** environment, click [here](https://www.42.us.org/).

If you do know what 42 is, and you've passed the Piscine, congrats! Hopefully you're looking at this to find some assitance with your first program. Great! A lot of learning you'll do here is based on seeing how other people have tackled challenges, learning, and improving.

libft is a project that teaches you how to build a C library, and will help you to understand a lot of basic functions you will use later on.

## Notes
First off, I've structured mine very differently than you should structure your project before you turn it in. Don't put all your files in folders.

Second off, the first place you should go to figure out a function is that function's man page.
`man strcmp`

Then you should take a look at and install [42 File Checker](). Super helpful project that will grade your project without you having to waste valuable correciton points and time.
